## **Paper at GW:**

##### **The paper below is a reflection I wrote on my Small Group Communication class. In this class, I worked with two different small groups on two different projects. The paper consists of reflecting on different concepts learned in class and how these concepts were potentially utilized in the group projects that I was working on. I also compared both group projects and looked back on how I progressed as a group member and student**
